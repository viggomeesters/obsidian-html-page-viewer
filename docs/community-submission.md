# Obsidian Community Submission Checklist

Current release target: `0.1.0`

## Repository

- [x] Public GitHub repository exists.
- [x] `README.md` describes what the plugin does and how to use it.
- [x] `LICENSE` exists.
- [x] `manifest.json` exists at repository root.
- [x] `manifest.json.id` is unique and does not contain `obsidian`.
- [x] `manifest.json.version` uses `x.y.z`.
- [x] `versions.json` maps plugin version to minimum Obsidian version.

## Release

- [x] `npm run build` passes.
- [x] `npx tsc --noEmit` passes.
- [x] `npm test` passes.
- [x] GitHub release tag equals `manifest.json.version`.
- [x] Release assets include `main.js`.
- [x] Release assets include `manifest.json`.
- [x] Release assets include `styles.css`.

## Artifact attestations

The repository contains `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `actions/attest-build-provenance@v3`. GitHub rejected workflow dispatch with `Actions has been disabled for this user`, so release `0.1.0` was created manually. Obsidian may therefore show a recommendation about missing artifact attestations until GitHub Actions is enabled for the account and a workflow-built release is published.
